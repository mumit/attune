# Architectural decisions

Newest first. This log records decisions that constrain current implementation.

## 2026-07 — Routes and MCP capability contracts fail fast

- Selecting a channel route is an operational commitment. Doctor now treats
  missing channel credentials, destinations, interaction allowlists, and Chat
  approval subscriptions as fatal configuration errors instead of letting the
  runtime silently omit delivery.
- An empty route explicitly disables that behavior and remains valid.
- The generic Workspace MCP adapter has a versioned contract. Version 1 requires
  four Gmail tools and two Calendar tools; Doctor checks `tools/list` before
  startup. The contract intentionally supports draft creation but not sending.
- Live Chat and MCP conformance remain deployment smoke tests because they
  require chosen external services and credentials; offline reference fixtures
  pin the protocol-independent behavior.

## 2026-07 — Rename and provider-neutral configuration

- The project, distribution, import package, CLI, state defaults, and current
  documentation are named Attune / `attune`.
- Model access uses `openai.OpenAI(api_key=..., base_url=...)`. Compatible
  gateways already use bearer authentication through the SDK, so the separate
  transport package was deleted.
- Base URLs, chat models, extraction model, embedding model, and dimensions are
  configuration. No gateway or model catalog is hardcoded.

## 2026-07 — One principal; portable deployment

- An instance represents one principal with isolated credentials, memory,
  workflow state, and audit data. There are no organization-named or
  personal/corporate configuration branches.
- Hosting target is operational configuration. Polling is portable and default;
  Google Pub/Sub is named explicitly wherever Google-specific infrastructure is
  required.

## 2026-07 — Google OAuth and MCP are both supported

- Direct Google OAuth is the default and supports polling and Pub/Sub.
- MCP Streamable HTTP is a real polling backend, not a placeholder. Its benefit
  is moving credentials, consent, policy, and auditing to a managed boundary;
  it is not assumed to provide richer product functionality.
- Shared and service-specific MCP endpoints are supported. Runtime startup and
  Doctor validate tool availability without loading Google user credentials.

## 2026-07 — Explicit optional-channel routing

- Slack and Google Chat are optional peers.
- Briefs and notifications can target multiple channels. Approvals target one
  channel to avoid decision races. Interaction surfaces are independently
  selectable.
- Google Chat app messages and card actions use a verified synchronous endpoint
  and stateless Pub/Sub handoff. Proactive Chat messages use a separate app
  service account, not the principal's Workspace OAuth credential.

## 2026-07 — Initializer edits instead of overwriting

- `attune init` loads an existing `.env`, masks secrets, uses current values as
  defaults, preserves comments and unknown variables, migrates legacy keys,
  creates a backup, writes atomically, and uses owner-only permissions.
- Blank keeps a value and `-` clears it. `--fresh` is the explicit destructive
  reset path.

## Durable workflow and security decisions

- LangGraph checkpoints all approval workflows; pending approvals survive
  restarts and resume idempotently.
- Autonomy is granted per action/domain and progresses from observe to draft to
  notify-after-action to autonomous action. The assistant never self-grants.
- Untrusted workspace content is provenance-tagged. Notification payloads are
  reconciliation signals rather than direct commands.
- The credential-holding runtime opens no public listener. The republisher is
  stateless and has only publish permissions.
- Source cursors advance after successful processing or durable retry enqueue.
- Human actors and proactive destinations are allowlisted/reviewed; all effects
  and authorization failures are appended to the audit trail.
- Mem0/Qdrant provide current memory storage behind an internal interface so a
  future temporal/entity store can replace them without changing workflows.
